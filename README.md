# Gauge Cluster

Gauge cluster is designed to be an automotive cluster of gauges and dials for use on an old tablet, phone, or Android-enabled headunit. It works by pulling data from the PCM/ECU over OBD-II, then decoding it and parsing it onto a simple cluster of gauges designed after a stock cluster. Documentation coming soon.
